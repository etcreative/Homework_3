We convert that keycode to a string (ie. if the user presses CharCode 65 on the keyboard the result will be "A").  Finally, we change the string character to a lower case.  
		userGuesses = userguess + userGuesses;


		//* Important take-aways.  The variable "userguess" will be re-assigned each time a user presses a key, as this function runs over and over.  The second, thing to remember, is the ".toLowerCase" function is called to account for user error by automatically converting the string to lower case.  This is important b/c we cant make sure the user is going to follow out instructions exactly.
